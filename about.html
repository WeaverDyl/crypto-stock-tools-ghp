			<h1>About Us (Me)</h1>
			<p>
			   This website was created by me, Dylan Weaver during the summer of 2018. 
			   It was created purely as a learning experience to learn some web development as well as Javascript skills.
			   This website features a collection of calculators used to give you information on various cryptocurrencies.
			   The intent is for it to be convenient to have all of these things in one place.
			</p>
			<p>
				I'm a rising junior at the 
				<a target="_blank" href="https://www.umd.edu/">University of Maryland, College Park</a>. 
				I'm studying computer science and I'm also minoring in philosophy. The minor in philosophy comes from a great interest 
				in logic and logical thinking, which is a topic that the computer science department at UMD doesn't seem to satisfy very well
				as a topic by itself, outside of discrete mathematics.
			</p>
			<p>
				If you're interested in seeing more of my work, feel free to visit my 
				<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/WeaverDyl">Github page</a>! I don't post much there, but many of
				my previous projects have been posted there, and I'm sure to post more in the future as well!
